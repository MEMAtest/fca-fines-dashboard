Individual enforcement actions and accountability.",content:`
## Senior Managers Regime and FCA Fines

The Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) has transformed individual accountability in financial services. Senior managers can now face personal FCA fines.

## SM&CR Overview

### Three Pillars
1. **Senior Managers Regime** - Individual accountability for senior roles
2. **Certification Regime** - Firm certification of key staff
3. **Conduct Rules** - Behavioral standards for all staff

### Key Features
- Statements of Responsibilities
- Duty of Responsibility
- Regulatory references
- Conduct rule breaches

## Individual FCA Fines Under SM&CR

### Statistics Since 2016
- **Individuals fined**: 45+
- **Total individual fines**: £18m+
- **Average fine**: £400,000
- **Prohibitions issued**: 120+

### Notable Individual Cases

**Case 1: Chief Compliance Officer - £76,000**
Failed to ensure adequate AML systems. Lesson: CCOs bear personal responsibility.

**Case 2: CEO - £642,000**
Failure to act with integrity, misleading FCA. Duty of candour paramount.

**Case 3: Head of Trading - £1.4m + prohibition**
Market manipulation. Conduct rules apply regardless of commercial pressure.

## The Duty of Responsibility

Senior managers can be held accountable if:
1. Firm breaches regulatory requirements
2. Breach occurs in their area of responsibility
3. They didn't take reasonable steps to prevent it

### "Reasonable Steps" Factors
- Nature and complexity of business
- Resources available
- Individual's knowledge and experience
- Actions taken to address known risks

## Protecting Yourself Under SM&CR

### Documentation
- Keep records of decisions
- Document oversight activities
- Maintain handover records
- Evidence of challenge

### Governance
- Clear delegation
- Regular MI review
- Escalation procedures
- Control testing

### Training
- Understand your responsibilities
- Know the conduct rules
- Regular refresher training
- Stay updated on enforcement

## Trends in Individual Enforcement

The FCA has signalled increased individual focus:
- More investigations of senior managers
- Greater use of prohibition powers
- Public censure of individuals
- Higher individual fines
